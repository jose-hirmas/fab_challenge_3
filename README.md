### "Sensorial Decisions" is an ethical tool for generating awareness about how sound affects behaviour and human decisions.

### Concept of the Project 

For this challenge, we are exploring how sound affects humans decisions. 

Based on design ethics, we started discussing about the non-neutrality of design, boundaries between technology and design, how design choices influence the functionality of society and the re-creation of reality.

Our common areas of interest are music, games, communication, interactive design and low tech with the purpose of seeking new ways of relationship between humans and non-humans. Through this, we are developing an artifact that allows human interaction, guided by different sounds, creating a final output of sound-paintings. The human interaction (input) is about drawing and being guided by the sounds. The final output is the drawing itself.

### Goals

- Visualize decision making through sound and drawings
- Work with electronics, Arduino, creativity and conductivity
- Explore unknown mediums: pure data, arduino, vinyl cutting copper
- Create a project that is realistic and doable in 4 days
- Exhibit the outcomes of decision making
- Generating awareness about the consequences of our actions

### Planification

Tuesday May 3rd:

-Brainstorm session
-Define tools
-Sketch ideas

Wednesday May 4th:

-Concept has been defined
-Design of the conductive surface is designed
-Test with 1 touchpin

Thursday May 5th:

-Test conductivity range with 8 touchpins
-Test out different drawing tools: finger, marker, pen, pencil...
-Laser cut base
-Vinyl cut copper design
-Program sounds with Pure Data
-Prototype with aluminium foil
-Complete prototype

Friday May 6th:

- Invite classmates to interact with the artifact, record sound.
- Prepare final drawings and connect sound
- Exhibit the art (sound paintings)

### Honest Design

Human senses are the main tools for using our artifact. Our fingers for drawing, our hearing for guidance, and our vision for percieving the final outcome. 

Technology (Arduino, Pure Data Music Software, Cables, and conductive surface) was used as a medium to "transform" the touching input into a sound output.

### Iteration process

**Solving problems with creativity**

1. Marker:
We wanted to use the big markers our drawing tools, except the conductivity was not optimal, when compare to using our fingers. We bypassed this problem by implanting 3 metal pins in the marker to enhance its performance. This gave us a range of 10 points as opposed to the previous 2-3, which was not reliable enough to make it usable.

2. Serigraphy:
Initially, we wanted to place paper on top of the copper plaques, but we soon realised that this would add too much resistance and not create a big enough variance in signal. To solve this, we decided to directly draw with the finger on the conductive surface and after put a paper on top to press against it. So the final drawing will stay on the paper. 

3. Paper:
After programming the frecuencies to the copper surface, we tried different types of paper for drawing and finally choose the baking sheet because the conductivity worked well between the finger and the surface.


### Future Development Oportunities

Analyzing the patterns of the drawing can be a way of understanding the proximity and relation that individuals have to specific frecuencies of sound.
