# Fab Challenge 3
## Design and make an “ethical tool or artifact” that allows you interact with others
by Kai, Joaquin, José and Tatiana.


### "Serigraphy of the Sound" is an ethical tool for generating awareness about how sound affects behaviour and human decisions.

### Concept of the Project 

For this challenge, we are exploring how sound affects humans decisions. 

Based on design ethics, we started discussing about the non-neutrality of design, boundaries between technology and design, how design choices influence the functionality of society and the re-creation of reality.

Our common areas of interest are music, games, communication, interactive design and low tech with the purpose of seeking new ways of relationship between humans and non-humans. Through this, we are developing an artifact that allows human interaction, guided by different sounds, creating a final output of sound-paintings. The human interaction (input) is about drawing and being guided by the sounds. The final output is the drawing itself.

### Goals

- Visualize decision making through sound and drawings
- Work with electronics, Arduino, creativity and conductivity
- Explore unknown mediums: pure data, arduino, vinyl cutting copper
- Create a project that is realistic and doable in 4 days
- Exhibit the outcomes of decision making
- Generating awareness about the consequences of our actions

### Planification

### Honest Design

Human senses are the main tools for using our artifact. Our fingers for drawing, our hearing for guidance, and our vision for percieving the final outcome. 

Technology (Arduino, Pure Data Music Software, Cables, and conductive surface) was used as a medium to "transform" the touching input into a sound output.

Copying the drawing of the conductive surface into a paper is made manually by the user, empowering the participant as an artist.


### Iteration process

**Solving problems with creativity**

1. Marker
We wanted to use the big markers our drawing tools, except the conductivity was not optimal, when compare to using our fingers. We bypassed this problem by implanting 3 metal pins in the marker to enhance its performance. This gave us a range of 10 points as opposed to the previous 2-3, which was not reliable enough to make it usable.

2. Serigraphy
Initially, we wanted to place paper on top of the copper plaques, but we soon realised that this would add too much resistance and not create a big enough variance in signal. To solve this, we decided to directly draw with the finger on the conductive surface and after put a paper on top to press against it. So the final drawing will stay on the paper. 


### Future Development Oportunities
(beyond)

Analyzing the patterns of the drawing can be a way of understanding the proximity and relation that individuals have to specific frecuencies of sound.
